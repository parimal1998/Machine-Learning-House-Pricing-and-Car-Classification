# R Machine Learning Projects – House Price Prediction & Car Classification

This repository contains two advanced analytics projects in R, demonstrating supervised machine learning techniques on two different datasets:
1. **House Price Prediction** using regression models
2. **Car Classification** using multiple classification models

Both projects are implemented using R and visualized through R Markdown and HTML reports.

## 🏠 Project 1: House Price Prediction

### 📌 Objective
To predict house prices based on various features using multiple regression techniques.

### 🔍 Techniques Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- XGBoost Regression

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- R² Score
- Train/Test split and Cross-validation

## 🚗 Project 2: Car Classification (ML Model Comparison)

### 📌 Objective
To classify cars based on features like buying price, safety, etc., and compare the performance of various classification models.

### 🔍 Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation
- Visualization of Model Comparisons

## 📁 Files Included

- `Advanced_Analytics_Project.Rproj` – Main RStudio project file.
- `RMarkdown_Report.html` – Full analysis report including both projects with results and visualizations.
- `.Rmd` and script files (if added later).

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Handling categorical and numerical data in R
- Comparing regression vs classification workflows
- Model tuning, cross-validation, and performance visualization
- Using libraries like `caret`, `xgboost`, `randomForest`, `rpart`, and `ggplot2`
